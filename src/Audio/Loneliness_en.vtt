1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.419
Everybody feels lonely from time to time

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.099
When we have no one to sit next to at lunch

3
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.419
or when nobody has time for us at the weekend.

4
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.320
this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.400
In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely.

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.640
In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly.

7
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.979
We are living in the most connected time in human history

8
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.519
and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated.

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.840
Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing.

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.000
You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second

11
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.059
Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience.

12
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.200
A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who

13
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.619
But population-based studies have shown that social skills make

14
00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.359
practically no difference for adults when it comes to social

15
00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.239
Loneliness can affect everybody.

16
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.920
social skills, a great personalityâ€”

17
00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.679
nothing can protect you against loneliness

18
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.140
because it's part of your biology.

19
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.299
Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger.

20
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.140
Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs;

21
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.740
loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs.

22
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.439
Your body cares about your social needs

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.239
it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive.

24
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.600
Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration

25
00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.739
and for forming connections with each other.

26
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.720
Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned

27
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.799
to recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain

28
00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.439
Being social became part of our biology

29
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.519
You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people

30
00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.219
which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life.

31
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.840
Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm

32
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580
or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone.

33
00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.819
So it was crucial that you got along with others.

34
00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.719
For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival

35
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.020
but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded.

36
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.979
To avoid that, your body came up with "social pain".

37
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.539
Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection.

38
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.500
A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour

39
00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.719
Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful

40
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.000
were more likely to change their behaviour when they got

41
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.099
and thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked

42
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.240
and even more so, why loneliness is so painful.

43
00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.539
These mechanisms for keeping us connected

44
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.780
worked great for most of our history

45
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.380
until humans began building a new world for themselves

46
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.919
The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the

47
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.520
Western culture began to focus on the individual.

48
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.300
Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle

49
00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.560
while the young Protestant theology stressed individual

50
00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.400
This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution.

51
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.060
People left their villages and fields to enter factories.

52
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.580
Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to

53
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.440
As our world rapidly became modern

54
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.840
this trend sped up more and more.

55
00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.519
Today, we move vast distances for new jobs

56
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.700
and leave our social net behind.

57
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.939
We meet fewer people in person

58
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.620
and we meet them less often than in the past.

59
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.180
In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from

60
00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.740
Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident.

61
00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:34.500
You reach adulthood and become busy with work

62
00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.680
The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with

63
00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.620
Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated

64
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.819
that you yearn for close relationships.

65
00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.659
But it's hard to find close relationships as adults

66
00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.399
and so, loneliness can become chronic.

67
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.460
While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and

68
00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.300
our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000

69
00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:13.979
We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other.

70
00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:21.719
large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from

71
00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.539
is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans

72
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.040
it makes you age quicker it makes cancer deadlier

73
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.735
loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity

74
00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.180
and as deadly as smoking a pack of ciggarettes a day

75
00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.379
the most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes

76
00:05:45.384 --> 00:05:48.185
chronic it can become self sustaining

77
00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:53.735
common mechanisms in your brain

78
00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:57.705
and so social pain leads to immediate

79
00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.680
your brain goes into self preservation mode

80
00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:09.674
it starts to see danger and hostility everywhere

81
00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:15.204
some studies found that when you're lonely your brain is much

82
00:06:15.204 --> 00:06:18.154
receptive and alert to social signals

83
00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:20.754
while at the same time it gets worse at

84
00:06:20.754 --> 00:06:22.105
gets worse at interpreting them correctly

85
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.120
you pay more attention to others but you understand them less

86
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.060
the part of you brain that recognises faces

87
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.545
get out of tune and becomes more

88
00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:34.585
likely to categorise neutral faces as hostile

89
00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:36.864
which makes it distrustful of others

90
00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.199
loneliness make you assume the worst about others intentions

91
00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:44.995
because of this perceived hostile world

92
00:06:44.995 --> 00:06:48.465
you can become more self-centred to protect yourself

93
00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:52.074
which can make you appear more cold unfriendly and

94
00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:54.259
socially awkward than you really are

95
00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.240
if loneliness has become a strong presence in your life

96
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.439
the first thing you can do is to try to recognise

97
00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.800
vicious cycle you may be trapped in

98
00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.680
it usually goes something like this

99
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.754
an initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of

100
00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:17.094
which makes you focus you attention selectively on negative

101
00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:22.939
this makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative

102
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.819
which then changes your behaviour

103
00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:28.475
you begin to avoid social interaction

104
00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:31.425
which leads to more feelings of isolation

105
00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:40.079
loneliness make you sit far away from others in class

106
00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:42.694
not answer the phone when friends call

107
00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:45.884
decline invitations until the invitations stop

108
00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:48.915
each and every one of us has a story about

109
00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:51.905
ourselves and if your story becomes that

110
00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.404
people exclude you others pick up on that

111
00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.099
and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it

112
00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:02.639
this is often a slow creeping process that takes years

113
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.760
and a mental state that can prevent connections even if you yearn

114
00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:12.500
the first thing you can do to escape it is to accept

115
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.319
that loneliness is a totally normal feeling

116
00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:20.805
literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their

117
00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:24.014
life its a universal human experience

118
00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:27.424
you can't eliminate or ignore a feeling until

119
00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:30.194
it goes away magically but you can accept that

120
00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:33.414
you feel it and get rid of its cause

121
00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:37.144
you can self examine what you focus your attention on

122
00:08:37.144 --> 00:08:39.914
and check if you are selectively focusing on

123
00:08:41.384 --> 00:08:44.434
was this interaction with a colleague rarely negative

124
00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:47.735
or was it really mutual or even positive

125
00:08:48.424 --> 00:08:51.504
what was the actual content of an interaction?

126
00:08:51.504 --> 00:08:52.919
what did the other person say?

127
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.235
did they say something bad or did you add

128
00:08:58.945 --> 00:09:02.165
maybe another person was not really reacting negatively but

129
00:09:04.804 --> 00:09:07.484
then there are your thoughts about the world

130
00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:10.205
are you assuming the worst about others intentions

131
00:09:10.205 --> 00:09:12.795
do you enter a social situation and have

132
00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:14.814
already decided how it will go?

133
00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.375
do you assume others don't want you around?

134
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.100
are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up

135
00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:25.379
and if so can you try to give others

136
00:09:25.384 --> 00:09:28.164
the benefit of the doubt can you just assume

137
00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:32.835
can you risk being open and vulnerable again?

138
00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:39.379
are you avoiding opportunities to be around others

139
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:42.840
are you looking of oppertunites to decline invitations

140
00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:47.379
or are you pushing away others preemptively to protect yourself

141
00:09:47.904 --> 00:09:50.324
are you acting as if you are getting attacked

142
00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:52.720
are you really looking for new connections

143
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.519
or have you become complacent with your situation

144
00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:59.565
of course every person in each situation is unique

145
00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:02.585
and different and just in introspection alone

146
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.985
if you feel unable to solve your situation alone by yourself

147
00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:10.245
please try to reach out and get professional help

148
00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:13.375
its not a sign of weakness but of courage

149
00:10:14.164 --> 00:10:17.094
however we look at loneliness as a purely individual

150
00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:20.065
problem that needs solving to create

151
00:10:20.065 --> 00:10:22.505
happiness or as a public health crisis

152
00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:25.225
it is something that deserves more attention

153
00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:28.945
humans have build a world that is nothing short of amazing

154
00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:32.004
and yet not of the shiny things we have made is able to

155
00:10:34.304 --> 00:10:37.314
our fundamental and biological need for connection

156
00:10:37.884 --> 00:10:40.625
most animals get what they need from their physical sourroundings

157
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:43.315
we get what we need from each other

158
00:10:43.975 --> 00:10:46.805
and we need to build our artificial human world

159
00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:56.419
lets try something together lets reach out to someone today

160
00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:00.345
regardless if you feel a little bit lonely

161
00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:02.540
or want to make someone else day better

162
00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:05.459
maybe write a friend you haven't spoken to in a while

163
00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:08.524
call a family member who has become estranged

164
00:11:08.894 --> 00:11:11.064
invite a work buddy for a coffee

165
00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:14.345
or just go to something you are usually to afraid to go to

166
00:11:14.345 --> 00:11:17.375
or too lazy to go to like a DMD event

167
00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:21.559
everybody is different so you know whats good for you

168
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.820
maybe nothing will come of it and that's okay

169
00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:28.154
don't do this with any expectations

170
00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:30.219
the goal is just to open up a bit

171
00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.259
to exercise your connection muscles so that they can grow stronger

172
00:11:34.845 --> 00:11:37.075
or to help others exercise them

173
00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:40.485
we want to recommend two of the books we read

174
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.340
how to deal with loneliness in a way that we found helpful and

175
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.134
loneliness, social nature and the need for social connection

176
00:11:56.134 --> 00:11:58.764
by John T. Cacloppo & William Patrick

177
00:11:58.934 --> 00:12:01.944
it's an entertaining and scientific exploration

178
00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:04.905
as to why we experience loneliness on a biological
