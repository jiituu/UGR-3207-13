        Everyone feels shitty at times. it's just how it is.
         all of us  , even Elon musk! yea crazy right? you should't blame yourself for feeling
        unworthy, unfullfules, and down. our brain is our enemy for most part .life with our brain 
         like "making deal with the devil" they said. 
         although feelings and emotions are normal there are certain limitation to feeling shitty and down
         so  when is it not normal? that's what most people tend to overlook.
        feeling down is ok but there are certain limits that we should not  pass inorder to live a sane life.
