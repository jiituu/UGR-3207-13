    <h3>This is for those of you wanting to end it</h3>
    <div id="1">
    <p>Most people have thought about it atleast once .Most of us can hardly imagine the suffering that
         precedes suicide and the pain left in its wake. When the person who dies is young, the devastation 
         is even more profound. The public, however—including most parents—remains disturbingly unaware of the 
         prevalence of suicide among young people. This is in part because, until recently, there was virtually
          no public health policy on the subject; in part because society is reluctant to discuss both suicide 
          and the mental illnesses most directly responsible for it; and in part because there is a pervasive 
          belief that suicide is highly idiosyncratic in nature and therefore neither predictable nor
           preventable.
           But we are not here to judge. we feel you and we are proud that you made it this far without anyone noticing
           how painful it was. the feelings you feel when when no one is around the feeling of unworhiness the fleelings of
           inadeguacy. those are the things that makes you

    <p> we all have our monsters and it's time to let them go</p>
    <p><h4>Reasons to live</h4></p>
    <div id="2">
    <p>Reason #1: You are Loved</p>

       <p> This is so important that I felt I needed to make it first. You are loved. No, 
        really, you are. Even if you don’t believe it. I promise you.
        
        
        . You are loved. Like Hannah Baker, we promise there are people in your life who 
        care about you more than you know. Maybe it’s your parents, or a teacher, or a friend, or 
        a secret admirer, or an internet friend, or a coworker. You may not feel loved, but 
        please know that you are. You have worth and value regardless of whether or not you feel it.
    </p>
      <p>Reason #2: You are strong enough to get through this</p>  
        
       <p> Think about it. Up until this point, you have survived 100% of 
        the things that life has thrown at you. Even in those days where you felt like you
         had barely enough energy to make it through one more hour, you survived. You have a death-less 
         streak happening right now. In the midst of our battles, it can feel like things will never change
          or never end. We can feel like we’ve finally hit the point of 
          no return. The good news is that 
          yes, you are strong enough to make it.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>Reason #3: Suicide is painful</p>
        
      <p>  
        
        I know this is a cliché. But please hear me out: things really do get better. They do! Whenever I present for Please Live in schools, I always tell students to just ignore it when someone says “these are the best days of your life.” You could not pay me enough money to be a teenager again. I hated it! But once I graduated high school it was like my world opened up before me.
        
        There will be a day where you can live the life you want. You can decorate your space however you want, eat what you want, make your own decisions about your life without the pressure or expectation of parents and teachers. This freedom is amazing and definitely worth experiencing. Things do get better.
        
        With treatment, whatever emotional turmoil you are experiencing does get better. Medicine does work. Therapy does work. Sometimes it takes a little longer than we’d like, but it does get better. I promise.
    </p>
    <p> Reason #6: There is help available</p>
        
        
       <p> I remember in the depths of my depression believing that I would 
        never make a mark on this world. I believed that if I wasn’t around anymore,
         no one would even notice.
      
        Today, I know that’s not true. Each human being, simply by virtue of being alive, has worth and value. The amount of lives you touch is far greater than you realize. People will notice, and as I wrote in reason #3, their lives will be colored with pain without you.
    </p>
      <p>  Reason #8: There’s a lot of good in the world</p>
        
       <p> The world is full of amazing things. </p>        
       <p>Reason #10: You still have good days</p> 
        <p>
        Even in the midst of depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts,
         good days still come. It’s still possible to laugh or to enjoy a good movie or
          listen to a catchy song. Sure, your soul inside may still be heavy and hurt, but 
          there’s still good days to be had. There’s still good out there. Hold onto it during 
          the bad days, savor the small bits of beauty to get you through the darkness.
